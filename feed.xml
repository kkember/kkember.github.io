                <p>A quiet day today catching up with the time change.  It's really warm here again today - heading up to 32.  The heat wave is supposed to end by Monday.  We didn't do much this am, had an early lunch and then took the subway over to Marks &amp; Spencer on Kensington High Street.  We picked up supper from the M&amp;S food hall, and I walked back to our airbnb through Holland Park - here are a few photos from along the way...</p>

<p>After getting home I had my second nap of the day :).  Janet stayed longer at M&amp;S and took the subway back.  Supper here, then coffee on the balcony watching the sun go down.  </p>

<p>Tomorrow we plan to go to Bermondsey Gospel Hall for the breaking of bread - it is about a 30-40 minute subway ride.  With an 11 am start time for the meeting, we won't need to be in a hurry tomorrow morning!</p>

                <p>Our England trip has begun!  We took an Uber to the Ottawa Airport for our 7pm flight to Toronto.  A short wait there for the overnight flight to London.  Didn't feel like we got much sleep but happy to be safely in London.  Customs was a breeze - there is a separate line for UK, US, Canadians, Australians etc and then a much longer one for everyone else - I guess it's a benefit of being a former colony...</p>

<p>We walked through to train area of the terminal and took the Elizabeth Line subway towards town.  This is a new line that just opened last year, and the trains are air conditioned!  Very pleased that our TD Visa card now works to tap and go on the tube - no need to buy tickets or cards, and no worrying about if you have enough money on the card for the rides for the day.</p>
<p>Our Airbnb host was very accommodating and had our place ready by noon instead of the usual 3pm check in time.  It is in the Kensington area of London along Holland Park Avenue, only about 200 metress from the subway.  Holland Park is lined with large trees and lots of cafes, bakeries, a small Tesco's, and even a book store!  The apartment is really nice with big windows, new cupboards and bathroom and a cute balcony.</p>

<p>We stowed our bags and went out for a piece of pizza and back to airbnb for a nap - Janet slept but I ended up trying to figure out how to switch our phones to UK sim cards and plans...</p>

<p>We headed out to Tesco's around 6:30 and picked up some ready made meals we could heat in the microwave.</p>
<p>In the evening we had our coffee out on the balcony and watched the light fade.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>For the final post of this series I thought I would share a bit of our daily routine on the trip as well as some reflections.</p>
<p>First, our daily routine...</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation</strong> - we used hotels.com to book our hotel each night.  We would generally book the night before - since we were in off season, we didn't have any issues.  An exception to this was for Yosemite and the Grand Canyon - we booked those places a few nights ahead.  Hotels.com makes it easy to see all the hotels in a given area and the ratings.  We found their ratings were pretty accurate - anything below an 8/10 wasn't the greatest.  Mostly we stayed at Fairfield (by Marriott) and Holiday Inn Express.  The Victorian Inn in Ferndale, Rush Creek Lodge in Yosemite, Bright Angel Lodge in the Grand Canyon were all unique hotel experiences (and also more expensive!).  Hotels.com also gives you a free night for every 10 stays, so we made use of that.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>...we stayed mostly in hotels that offered a free breakfast.  Many of them had real oatmeal, bacon and eggs, toast/bagels, juice, yogurt etc.  Before leaving the hotel I would fill up our two thermoses with tea from the breakfast area, and refill our water bottles.  For lunch we would usually stop at a rest area or some pretty spot if we could find one and have bread and cheese, along with our tea and some chocolate.  We stored cheese etc in our Yeti cooler.  It kept things quite cold - I would change the ice every day if it was warm and every other day when colder out.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/IMG_0729.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0729-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3024" height="4032"></figure>
<p>This meant we didn't have to find a place to buy lunch every day, and with a large breakfast we didn't need a big lunch.  For supper we would usually eat out somewhere.  A couple of times we found a Panera Bread and had soup and a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>Driving in the van</strong>... we found that 4-5 hours of driving a day was a good amount.  We could do the occasional long day of 7-9 hours, but we tried not to do too many of those in a row. I would usually drive in the morning.  After lunch Janet would drive while I had a nap.  We used google maps on my phone for navigation and it worked well.  Occasionally we would override google's choice of route if we wanted something more scenic.   Even though it was just two of us, having the van was so much more comfortable than a car.  A long wheel base means a smoother ride, you sit up a bit higher, and we had plenty of room for stuff we bought along the way.  The Odessey also has a very large gas tank of 21 gallons.  At optimal highway driving, we could go more than 1000 km on one tank, although a<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">fter our near miss in northern Michigan, we always looked to keep the gas gauge well above a quarter full!  We listened to audiobooks (</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Lord of the Rings narrated by Andy Serkus - we made it through books 1 and 2 and partway into book 3) </span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">for quite a bit of the way (unless it was a really scenic section like Glacier National Park).</span></p>
<p>One advantage of the interstate system are the rest areas along these roads.  They are generally well maintained and located in pretty spots along the road, and spaced out every 30-40 miles or so.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> I also brought a small Ryobi cordless vaccum to keep the van clean.  </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/IMG_0732.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_0732-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>It sounds a bit silly, but when you spending that much time in the van, climbing into a relatively clean vehicle each morning is so much more pleasant!</p>
<p>Some overall reflections:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>the sheer size of North America - especially the mid-west.  When you drive for days and still are a long way from the coast, the distance sinks in a bit more</li>
<li>the variety of landscapes - we expected some parts to be flat and somewhat boring, but each part of the country has its own charm.  There were some surprises along the way - the scenery from Glacier National Park to Kalispell, the mountain pass to get into Yosemite, the drive from Kayenta to Moab, and the mountain passes coming into Denver from the west. </li>
<li>a flexible schedule allowed for unexpected sightseeing - quite a number of times we happened upon areas that were worth exploring and so we stopped and checked them out - the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the town of Ferndale, the Humbolt Redwoods State Park in Northern California, the town square in Washington Illinois.  I suppose if we had done more research in advance these wouldn't have been surprises.  Still, it was nice to have the flexibility to stop and enjoy these places.  </li>
<li>being able to get off the Interstate and use other roads makes for more interesting driving.  And many of these secondary highways are quite good and have a speed limit of 65 mph so you can still make good time.  We enjoyed these roads in Montana, the Oregon Coast, the trip to Yosemite, and heading north from Kayenta.</li>
<li>meeting up with family, friends and fellow-believers.  Seeing where Mitch lives in California and spending time with him, dinner with Carolyn and Steve, visiting with Joe and Penny Clark in Montana, and being with the believers in Spring Creek - these were all highlights of our trip.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an overall map of our trip...</p>

<p>We left our hotel in Port Huron at 7am this morning while it was still dark.  Happy to see no lineup at customs.</p>

<p>A friendly customs officer asked us how the trip went, and then waved us on through.  On to the 402 through to the 401 and to Ottawa, with just a couple of quick stops.  It looks like the fall colors are at their peak here.</p>

<p>We arrived home around 3pm - so nice to see familiar territory.  Everything is in good shape at 874 Clearcrest -  Amy took good care of the house while we were gone, even raking the leaves!  </p>
<p>She had us over for a delicious supper - really nice way to ease back into home life again!</p>

<p>I'm planning one more post tomorrow to wrap up this series - a little bit about our daily routine on the trip, and some overall reflections. </p>

<p>The auditorium is really nicely done, with high ceilings and big windows on each side.</p>

<p>Several of the believers there remembered Alan and Rhonda (in particular Brent and Kerwin).  It's funny, I remember there being a lot of younger people, but somehow they have all gotten older over the last 27 years!  We met Matt Slabaugh, who is a grandson of John Slabaugh, the preacher.  I remember going to Akron conference with dad and staying at the Slabaugh's place.  It was really nice to be with them for the morning.  After the breaking of bread they have a break, then a gospel meeting.  Then the kids go to sunday school and there is 30 minutes of ministry.  A lot of the christians live a long distance away so having everything Sunday morning works well.</p>
<p>John and Esther Kregel were visiting from Garnavillo Iowa - I think one of their kids lives in Chicago.  We had a nice visit with them - they were wondering how mom was doing and have happy memories of "Uncle Tim".  They remember mom and dad and Uncle Shad and Aunt Anne staying with them on one of their US trips out to the west coast.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/IMG_0708.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/34/responsive/IMG_0708-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>We left around 12:30 and headed east again for Port Huron.  We arrived around 8pm local time - losing another hour so now we are back on Ottawa time, and in sight of the border!</p>

                <p>This morning we headed out around 9:30 to a Target store just across the street from our hotel.  I don't think we've been in a Target since they were in Canada a few years ago.  No comparison - this store is well-stocked, organized and a pleasure to shop in!  We then got on the road to head to Bloomington, about 45 minutes away to the Mouton Rouge Knittery...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/IMG_5084.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p>I had a nap while Janet shopped - she says they have a lot of yarn, but it is a bit disorganized - a bit like the shop Janet used to work at in Orleans a few years ago.</p>
<p>We drove on to Joliet, which is just below Chicago to our hotel.  A short one hour 45 minute drive. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/IMG_5099.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We plan to be at Spring Creek Gospel Hall located here for the breaking of bread tomorrow.  This meeting used to be called New Lennox - Alan and Rhonda were here when they lived in Chicago.  I remember going to the meeting with them back in 1995 - I had just started at EDC and there was a work conference in Chicago.  I stayed with Alan and Rhonda for a couple of nights and we drove to the New Lennox meeting on Sunday morning.  It was a fairly lengthy drive as I recall - I think Alan and Rhonda lived north of Chicago and Joliet is south of the city.</span></p>
<p>After we checked into our hotel - we thought we would walk to Starbucks which was only 500 metres away.  It started off well on a pretty residential street, but we ended up foiled by the USA car culture!  The sidewalks ran out, and no place to cross a four lane highway - so we walked back to the hotel and drove!</p>

<p>For supper we decided on Olive Garden - a short 15 minute drive away...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379..jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure>
<p>Really delicious meal - quite full tonight.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon we plan to drive to Port Huron, and then Monday, cross the border into Sarnia and head for home!</p>

                <p>A chilly 5 degreees this morning!  We had a leisurely morning as we only had about 4.5 hours to drive today.  We got away around 9:30 heading east again the I-80.  We stopped for lunch at a rest area - these are so handy for washroom breaks, changing drivers, and having lunch.  They seem to be spaced every 40 miles or so along some interstate highways.  They aren't usually very busy, unlike EnRoutes along the 401.  They have nice spots to have lunch, but it was really windy so we ate in the van.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel in Des Moines Iowa around 2pm and were able to check in early.  We drove to a nearby Cariboo Coffee for our afternoon coffee and then headed to "Fabrics and Fun" (more fun for Janet than me :)).  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/IMG_4989.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_4989-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure>
<p>Driving back we stopped at a christian bookstore - a more normal one this time - no wigs!  We had supper at a Cracker Barrel - first time on this trip.  This brought back memories of our trip to Florida with Mitch and Amy many years ago where we ate at Cracker Barrel many times!</p>

<p>The Cracker Barrel store is in full christmas mode...</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have another fairly short drive to Washington Illinois, just outside Chicago.  The odometer shows that we have now crossed the 10,000 km mark - we are at 10,464 km as of today.</p>

                <p>We packed up and left the airbnb around 9:30 this morning and headed north to Fort Collins, about an hour from Denver.  Janet wanted to visit the Loopy Ewe, a large yarn store there.</p>

<p>I decided to visit a christian bookstore which turned out to be further away than I thought and quite underwhelming.  Actually it was a bit weird - christian books and wigs - never knew that they go together!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0599-2.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Anyway, it was a pretty drive to get there and by the time I got back, Janet was finished up at the Loopy Ewe (gotta love the name!).  We had lunch in the van, and then headed for Kearney, Nebraska.  We were heading north a bit and entered Wyoming, then headed east and crossed the state line into Nebraska.  Very flat country, big open skies, and interesting cloud formations...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0605.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0601.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"> </figure>
<p>With a further time change, we are now just an hour ahead of Ottawa.  We got to Kearney around 7:30pm and checked into our hotel.  The hotel staff person recommended a nearby restaurant called Cunningham Journal (and it is a restaurant, not a newspaper).  We headed there and had nachos and quesadillas - really good, and served up pretty quickly.  It feels like we are in the middle of nowhere, but apparently Kearney is the sandhill crane capital of the world - who knew!  </p>
<p>And finally - here is tonight's hotel room wall art - you'll recall that the hotel near Yosemite had a wolf staring down at us - here we have a terrified looking horse...</p>

<p>Janet says I must be getting desperate for blog material if I'm profiling hotel wall art :)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head for Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

                <p>Another quiet day in Denver.  A few facts about this city... it is called the "Mile-High City" because its elevation is 5200 feet or one mile.  The population is around 3.5 million.  The area gets 300 days of sunshine a year!  And it snows in winter, but unlike Ottawa it doesn't usually last long on the ground.</p>
<p>I got the van washed this morning, trying to get some of the bugs off the grill and windshield.  This afternoon we went to the Park Meadows Mall about 20 minutes away.  It is a huge mall with Nordstroms, JC Penny, LL Bean, and many, many more.  </p>
<p>After we got back, I took a walk to a park nearby - the James R. Bible park - apparently named after a Denver Parks employee from many years ago.  </p>
<p>On the way there you can see the mountains off to the west.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/IMG_0587.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0587-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>The park is a pretty spot, with lots of wide open space and beautiful trees.  It connects to the Highline Canal Trail, which winds through the whole city.</p>

<p>I picked up a quiche for supper from Safeway nearby.  Tomorrow we head north to Fort Collins, about an hour north of Denver to visit the Loopy Ewe Yarn Shop and then head east to Kearney, Nebraska.</p>
