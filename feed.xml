<p>The assembly there is now called Spring Creek Gospel Hall.  They have a beautiful building completed in 2016.</p>

<p>The auditorium is really nicely done, with high ceilings and big windows on each side.</p>

<p>Several of the believers there remembered Alan and Rhonda (in particular Brent and Kerwin).  It's funny, I remember it is as being a lot of younger people, but somehow they have all gotten older over the last 27 years!  We met Matt Slabaugh, who is a grandson of John Slabaugh, the preacher.  I remember going to Akron conference with dad and staying at the Slabaugh's place.  It was really nice to be with them for the morning.  After the breaking of bread they have a break, then a gospel meeting.  Then the kids go to sunday school and there is 30 minutes of ministry.  A lot of the christians live a long distance away so having everything Sunday morning works well.</p>
<p>John and Esther Kregel were visiting from Garnavillo Iowa - I think one of their kids lives in Chicago.  We had a nice visit with them - they were wondering how mom was doing and have happy memories of "Uncle Tim".  They remember mom and dad and Uncle Shad and Aunt Anne staying with them on one of their US trips out to the west coast.</p>

<p>We left around 12:30 and headed east again for Port Huron,  We arrived around 8pm local time - losing another hour so now we are back on Ottawa time, and in sight of the border!</p>

                <p>This morning we headed out around 9:30 to a Target store just across the street from our hotel.  I don't think we've been in a Target since they were in Canada a few years ago.  No comparison - this store is well-stocked, organized and a pleasure to shop in!  We then got on the road to head to Bloomington, about 45 minutes away to the Mouton Rouge Knittery...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/IMG_5084.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5084-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p>I had a nap while Janet shopped - she says they have a lot of yarn, but it is a bit disorganized - a bit like the shop Janet used to work at in Orleans a few years ago.</p>
<p>We drove on to Joliet, which is just below Chicago to our hotel.  A short one hour 45 minute drive. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/IMG_5099.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/IMG_5099-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We plan to be at Spring Creek Gospel Hall located here for the breaking of bread tomorrow.  This meeting used to be called New Lennox - Alan and Rhonda were here when they lived in Chicago.  I remember going to the meeting with them back in 1995 - I had just started at EDC and there was a work conference in Chicago.  I stayed with Alan and Rhonda for a couple of nights and we drove to the New Lennox meeting on Sunday morning.  It was a fairly lengthy drive as I recall - I think Alan and Rhonda lived north of Chicago and Joliet is south of the city.</span></p>
<p>After we checked into our hotel - we thought we would walk to Starbucks which was only 500 metres away.  It started off well on a pretty residential street, but we ended up foiled by the USA car culture!  The sidewalks ran out, and no place to cross a four lane highway - so we walked back to the hotel and drove!</p>

<p>For supper we decided on Olive Garden - a short 15 minute drive away...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379..jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/33/responsive/45F39411-B990-49A7-85F8-0274BFC98379.-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure>
<p>Really delicious meal - quite full tonight.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon we plan to drive to Port Huron, and then Monday, cross the border into Sarnia and head for home!</p>

                <p>A chilly 5 degreees this morning!  We had a leisurely morning as we only had about 4.5 hours to drive today.  We got away around 9:30 heading east again the I-80.  We stopped for lunch at a rest area - these are so handy for washroom breaks, changing drivers, and having lunch.  They seem to be spaced every 40 miles or so along some interstate highways.  They aren't usually very busy, unlike EnRoutes along the 401.  They have nice spots to have lunch, but it was really windy so we ate in the van.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hotel in Des Moines Iowa around 2pm and were able to check in early.  We drove to a nearby Cariboo Coffee for our afternoon coffee and then headed to "Fabrics and Fun" (more fun for Janet than me :)).  </p>

<p>Driving back we stopped at a christian bookstore - a more normal one this time - no wigs!  We had supper at a Cracker Barrel - first time on this trip.  This brought back memories of our trip to Florida with Mitch and Amy many years ago where we ate at Cracker Barrel many times!</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have another fairly short drive to Washington Illinois, just outside Chicago.  The odometer shows that we have now crossed the 10,000 km mark - we are at 10,464 km as of today.</p>

                <p>We packed up and left the airbnb around 9:30 this morning and headed north to Fort Collins, about an hour from Denver.  Janet wanted to visit the Loopy Ewe, a large yarn store there.</p>

<p>I decided to visit a christian bookstore which turned out to be further away than I thought and quite underwhelming.  Actually it was a bit weird - christian books and wigs - never knew that they go together!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0599-2.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0599-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Anyway, it was a pretty drive to get there and by the time I got back, Janet was finished up at the Loopy Ewe (gotta love the name!).  We had lunch in the van, and then headed for Kearney, Nebraska.  We were heading north a bit and entered Wyoming, then headed east and crossed the state line into Nebraska.  Very flat country, big open skies, and interesting cloud formations...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0605.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0605-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0601.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0601-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"> </figure>
<p>With a further time change, we are now just an hour ahead of Ottawa.  We got to Kearney around 7:30pm and checked into our hotel.  The hotel staff person recommended a nearby restaurant called Cunningham Journal (and it is a restaurant, not a newspaper).  We headed there and had nachos and quesadillas - really good, and served up pretty quickly.  It feels like we are in the middle of nowhere, but apparently Kearney is the sandhill crane capital of the world - who knew!  </p>
<p>And finally - here is tonight's hotel room wall art - you'll recall that the hotel near Yosemite had a wolf staring down at us - here we have a terrified looking horse...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/IMG_0609.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0609-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Janet says I must be getting desperate for blog material if I'm profiling hotel wall art :)</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head for Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

                <p>Another quiet day in Denver.  A few facts about this city... it is called the "Mile-High City" because its elevation is 5200 feet or one mile.  The population is around 3.5 million.  The area gets 300 days of sunshine a year!  And it snows in winter, but unlike Ottawa it doesn't usually last long on the ground.</p>
<p>I got the van washed this morning, trying to get some of the bugs off the grill and windshield.  This afternoon we went to the Park Meadows Mall about 20 minutes away.  It is a huge mall with Nordstroms, JC Penny, LL Bean, and many, many more.  </p>
<p>After we got back, I took a walk to a park nearby - the James R. Bible park - apparently named after a Denver Parks employee from many years ago.  </p>
<p>On the way there you can see the mountains off to the west.</p>

<p>The park is a pretty spot, with lots of wide open space and beautiful trees.  It connects to the Highline Canal Trail, which winds through the whole city.</p>

<p>I picked up a quiche for supper from Safeway nearby.  Tomorrow we head north to Fort Collins, about an hour north of Denver to visit the Loopy Ewe Yarn Shop and then head east to Kearney, Nebraska.</p>

                <p>We had an enjoyable quiet day today after all the driving yesterday.  A leisurely morning, cleaned out the van, lunch, a nap.  Then I drove Janet to Fancy Tiger Crafts Co-op, about 15 minutes away.  While she was there I checked out Rockler Woodworking which was nearby - lots of neat stuff, sort of like Lee Valley but more exclusively focused on woodworking.</p>

<p>Back at the condo had coffee on the balcony - it's a great place to sit and read.</p>

<p>Carolyn and Steve had invited us over for supper - their house is about 10 minutes from our condo.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/IMG_0585.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/28/responsive/IMG_0585-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>We had a really nice supper with them - it's been a long time since we've seen Carolyn and we hadn't met Steve or Natalie and Vanessa, so it was so nice to spend time with them this evening!</p>

<p>We crossed from Arizona into Utah, and then eventually into Colorado.  After a very flat section, we ended up following the Colorado River for much of the way to Denver along Interstate 70.  Alan had warned us that I-70 can be very congested on a Sunday afternoon as people from Denver return from the mountains back to the city.  And indeed, there were a number of slowdowns, but overall it ended up being ok.  It seemed like we were driving through mountain passes for the last three hours or so - either up steep grades or down equally steep slopes with frequent warnings to trucks to use low gear, and check their brakes, and places for trucks to cool their brakes and to put chains on and off in the winter.</p>

<p>It was nice to see some fall colours too - yellow leaves against the green slopes and grey rock above.  Colorado is a beautiful state!</p>

<p>We arrived at our airbnb in Denver around 5:30.  It is very comfortable and is centrally located, so we are looking forward to spending a couple of days here!</p>

<p>We got back to the lodge and decided to take the Bright Angel Trail down into the Canyon.  We thought about trying to get to the canyon floor, but changed our minds when we realized that was a ten mile hike - that was just going down.  Lots of signs warned that coming back up takes twice as long - so we decided to just head down for 20-30 minutes and then head back up.  It is a series of switchbacks with steep drop offs, and we were glad we didn't go much further....</p>

<p>We left the park around 12:30 and headed for Kayenta Arizona.  Smooth driving until we hit a town called Tuba City - a major traffic jam where we were stuck for two hours.  It seemed like some kind of Navajo event was going on with very little traffic control or organization so we inched along and finally got clear of it and arrived in Kayenta around 8pm local time (an hour later than California, two hours earlier than Ottawa).  Tomorrow we have a lengthy drive to Denver so hope to make an early start!</p>

                <p>We left our hotel this morning around 9am and headed east towards Arizona.  We stopped at a rest stop for lunch as usual.  Some interesting landscapes along the way...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/IMG_0412.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0412-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>We drove to the south rim of the canyon and had no trouble getting into the park (I had read online that on busy weekends it can take 45 minutes to 2 hours to get into the park).  We found our hotel - the Bright Angel Lodge - which is located on the rim of the canyon.  We have a small but comfortable cabin.  Parking is a challenge - there is no designated parking for the lodge and so if you find a spot, you keep it otherwise you might need to park a mile away!  We were lucky to get a spot close by.  We headed out on the canyon rim trail.  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/IMG_0432.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/IMG_0432-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3948" height="2962"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/DSC02825.JPG" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-xs.JPG 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-sm.JPG 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-md.JPG 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/25/responsive/DSC02825-2xl.JPG 1600w"  alt="" width="6000" height="4000"></figure>
<p>The view is stunning - the canyon is about 5000 feet deep.  It is really hard to grasp the scope of it - and photos certainly don't do it justice.  It is a bit alarming to see what people will do at the edge of the canyon to get a good photo - going off the path and  posing at the very edge with their back to canyon, or sitting with their legs dangling over the side.</p>
<p>We walked for a couple of hours and watched the sun set and the light slowly fade from the canyon walls before heading back for dinner at a restaurant near the hotel and then back to our cabin.</p>

<p>Notice the people in the two photos below - helps give a sense of perspective.</p>

<p>A bit harder to see them in this one, but look closely at the top right corner....this is Mather Point where most people come look especially if they only have a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we plan to take a shuttle bus to other viewpoints of the canyon, and also hike a short way down the Bright Angel Trail into the canyon.  We don't plan to go far as coming back up will be much harder!</p>
