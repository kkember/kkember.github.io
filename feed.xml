                <p>We were on the road by 8:15 this morning and headed for Portland and on to the Oregon Coast.  As soon as we crossed the Columbia River we were in Oregon.  The interstate then followed the south bank of the Columbia River for many miles.  It's a big river, with train tracks running along both sides of it, and very few towns along its banks - it seems quite desolate.</p>

<p>Eventually we came to Portland and then headed south-west towards the coast.  The landscape is much greener here - lots of trees, vineyards and orchards.  </p>

<p>As we got closer to the coast, we entered a forested area with big trees thickly lining the winding road.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/IMG_0098.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0098-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>We arrived in Lincoln City on the coast around 2pm.  Checked into our hotel, and walked over to a nearby Starbucks for coffee.  Since we had some time before supper I decided to get the oil changed at a Valvoline drive in place just down the road.  On the way back I stopped at the beach and watched the waves rolling in...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/IMG_0099.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0099-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>We decided to walk to a nearby fish and chip place for supper.  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/IMG_0101.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0101-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>The owner was the talkative sort - he said he works 12 hours a day and so far today has 14,000 steps for today alone.  He also told us this place has the best fish and chips in the state of Oregon.  It was excellent - thin, crispy batter and flaky fish - we had some halibut and cod.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/IMG_0104.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_0104-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We walked back to our hotel in the light rain, feeling very full indeed!</span></p>

<p>Breakfast starts at 6 and we were there when they opened!  This hotel (Country Inn by Radisson) has the best breakfast so far!  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/IMG_3706.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3706-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure>
<p>We were off about 8:30.  We had decided to take a more scenic route through the Kootenai National Forest, but google maps kept trying to re-route us using interstate highways, so we ended up circling around Kalispell before actually getting underway. We were glad we took the National Forest route as although it added 30 minutes of driving, it was a lot more scenic (although nothing could match yesterday in Glacier National Park).</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/IMG_3875.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3875-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p>We ended up traveling through three states today (Montana, Idaho, Washington) and one time zone change so we are now three hours behind Ottawa.  I didn't realize that a narrow slice of Idaho comes up between Montana and Washington until we saw the road signs.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/IMG_3940.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_3940-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p>There are still lots of mountains, although more like the green mountains of Vermont.  In many places there were misty clouds amongst the hills, perhaps because of the colder air temperature.  We passed through several little towns in the valleys - Libby, Troy, and then into Idaho and a bigger city called Bonner's Ferry.</p>
<p>We stopped for lunch by this lake. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/DSC02584.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/15/responsive/DSC02584-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="6000" height="4000"></figure>
<p>From there, Janet drove the rest of the way to our hotel in Pasco/Tri-Cities in Washington, about mid-way between Spokane and Portland.  The landscape here is much flatter - more like the eastern parts of Montana.  It is 29 degrees here - quite a change from 4 degrees this morning in Montana.  We hope to get to the coast tomorrow!</p>

                <p>We made an early start this morning from Great Falls and headed north towards Glacier National Park.  All along the way we could see the mountains to our left.  Eventually we left the interstate and headed west towards those mountains and the entrance to the park.  We were taking the "Going to the Sun" road which crosses through the park via Logan pass.  This road is only open in the summer and fall until early October.  It is narrow, winding, with the most incredible views imaginable.  Fortunately there are frequent areas where you can pull off the road to take pictures.  In the summer the road is so popular that you have to reserve a spot in advance for the day you want to drive it to help them manage the traffic flows.  It was busy today too, but not too bad.  Every corner brings into view a new vista - it is very hard to capture it in photos...</p>

<p>You wind up to the mountain pass for the first part of the drive, and at times you can see the road after the pass down in the valley far below.  The road hugs the mountain side and there is a steep drop off to the left for most of the way.  This photo gives you an idea...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/DSC02539.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/DSC02539-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="6000" height="4000"></figure>
<p>We stopped part way through and had our lunch and then continued on.  Eventually you descend from the pass and follow the river bottom to the other side of the mountain range.</p>

<p>It is without doubt the most spectacular drive I've ever been on!</p>
<p>We drove to a town on the west side of the park called Kalispell where our hotel for the night was located.  We were blessed with beautiful weather all day - sunshine and 20 degrees.</p>
<p>PS - I decided to add in a few more photos - there are so many to choose from!</p>

                <p>We were up early this morning - with the time change we are waking up about 5am.  We had breakfast in the hotel and then headed for the meeting in Sun River, a small town about 20 minutes from Great Falls.  The meeting is comprised of a number of people who have left Hutterite colonies in the area along with some others, and lots of kids!  Joe and Penny Clark kindly invited us to their place for lunch.  They live on the top of a hill above the town, with fields and blue sky all around.</p>

<p>We left their house about 2:30 to head back to Great Falls.  A beautiful drive - horses, cattle, some sheep...</p>

<p>Back at our hotel, I had a nap, and then we walked over to the grocery store next door to get some supplies for tomorrow, as well as something for supper tonight, although we don't need much after a big lunch.  We hope to make an early start tomorrow for the drive through Glacier National Park.</p>

<p>We arrived in Great Falls around 3:30pm.  It was nice to get into our hotel before supper and be able to relax a little.  Driving 5-6 hours a day doesn't sound like much but when you do it day after day it becomes tiring!  We plan to stay here in Great Falls tonight (Saturday night) as well as Sunday night.  Tomorrow we plan to go the breaking of bread in Sun River, about 20 minutes away.  Joe and Penny Clark have kindly invited us for lunch after the meeting there.  Monday we plan to drive through Glacier National Park on the "Going to the Sun" road which winds through the park.</p>

                <p>This morning after breakfast at the hotel, we headed to TJ Maxx - a store sort of like Winners in Canada, but nicer.  Janet found some pairs of shoes that she really liked along with a few other things.  Then we headed west once again on the I-94.  We were passing through Bismarck, North Dakota and I noticed there was a Hobby Lobby there so we stopped.  Janet did some shopping there and at Joanne's Fabrics, and I had a lovely nap in the van.  After some lunch, we headed back on the road.  The landscape became more hilly, and then we came to Theodore Roosevelt National Park and decided to stop and check it out.  It is unlike anything I've ever seen - a sort of badlands with rocky outcropings and gullies running through it.</p>

<p>There is a scenic drive you can take through the park, so we paid the entrance fee and drove in.  It was well-worth it - spectacular scenery!  </p>
<p>We came across some bison - one of which was on the road - they are huge animals!</p>

<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/IMG_3246.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_3246-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>

<p>Then we drove on and crossed the state line into Montana.  The speed limit here is 80 mph (130 kph)!  I ended up driving 120-125 - it just feels too weird to be driving 130!  We got to our spot for the night - Glendive Montana - a small town where we will leave the I-94 tomorrow and head northwest to Great Falls Montana.  </p>

                <p>This morning we woke up to a chlly 4 degrees in Duluth.  We are enjoying breakfast - the Fairfield Inn has a good one and even Janet is getting into oatmeal, especially when you have lots of choices for toppings....</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/IMG_0038.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_0038-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3024" height="4032"></figure>
<p>We headed over the mall across the street at 10 am when it opened and browsed through a huge Barnes and Noble bookstore.  Their bibles section is quite a bit larger than what you would see in Ottawa!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9..jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/E115A365-DB09-48AB-B228-9422B8C541E9.-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>
<p>Then we visited a very large shoe warehouse and Janet and I each got a pair.  We picked up a couple of croissants at a nearby Panera Bread, and after a quick lunch in the van we were on the road west again.</p>
<p>As we left Minnesota and headed into North Dakota, the countryside flattened out and it felt a lot like the Canadian prairies - big expanses of open sky and the interstate running as straight as an arrow for miles.  The speed limit is 75 mph (120 kph) - for construction zones it drops to 65 mph (105 kph)!  At that speed you make pretty good time.  We passed Fargo North Dakota and eventually reached our destination for tonight - Jamestown North Dakota.  Just before our turnoff, I saw a sign saying we had crossed the continental divide - so from here on waterways flow west to the Pacific ocean.  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/IMG_3187.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/10/responsive/IMG_3187-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="3264" height="2448"></figure>
<p>We checked in to our hotel, and then headed out for a quick supper at Taco John's followed by dessert at Dairy Queen.  We have about 10 hours from here to make it to Great Falls Montana by Saturday night - so roughly 5 hours of driving Friday and Saturday.  We plan to be at the meeting in nearby Sun River on Sunday.</p>

                <p>We had a leisurely breakfast in the hotel this morning because we wanted to stop by Scripture Gift and Book Shop which doesn't open until 10 am.  The current owner was surprised to learn that Janet was Margaret Frizelle's granddaughter and worked in the store during high school.  We had a nice visit with her - she and her husband really seem to enjoy running the store.  They have a nice selection of books and they managed to stay afloat during the pandemic by setting up an online store and having curbside pickup.  </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0022.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Then we headed for the bridge to the USA - a very short wait at the border - the US customs lady was very friendly, and surprised to learn we were driving to California!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_3163.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure>
<p>Soon we were across and into Michigan, and we headed west across the Upper Peninsula towards Duluth.  After driving for quite a while through what seemed a very remote area with no towns, stores or gas stations, I suddenly realized we were very nearly out of gas.  The van has a big tank - the last fill up was near Renfrew yesterday, and I had meant to fill up in the Soo this morning but forgot!  Google maps showed that fortunately a gas station was just 7 miles ahead - we landed there with our gauge showing a range of 22 km left which is too close for comfort - not sure how accurate it is and I don't want to find out!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0023.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>After filling up the tank and having lunch, we drove on.  We stopped at the little lakeside town of Munising, Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior - really pretty spot.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0027.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0027-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0031.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0031-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Further on we came to beautiful sand beaches with big rolling waves...</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0035.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0035-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0033-1.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0033-1-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>Even though we started later in the day, it seemed like a long day of driving.  We ended up switching up drivers a few times.   We were on two-lane highways rather than interstate highways so that makes it more interesting driving.  Similar to highway 17, they have passing lanes every so often and the speed limit is 65 mph most of the time.  Finally we pulled into Duluth around 7:30pm - the time is an hour earlier here so it's 6:30 Minnesota time.   The last time we were in Duluth was 31 years ago, just after we were married - we did the Great Circle Route around Superior - Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay to Duluth and then back to the Soo along the south side of Lake Superior.  </p>
<p>There is a mall across from our hotel so we headed over there for a burger at Five Guys - will check out the mall tomorrow as there is a huge Barnes and Noble store :).</p>

<p>The skies cleared as we headed northwest along highway 17 towards Renfrew.  We had a brief stop for gas in Cobden and then carried on to a roadside stop near Mattawa - we've stopped here several times when heading to Thunder Bay.  It is a nice quiet spot to have lunch.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/IMG_0018.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0018-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>After lunch Janet drove and I had a nap.  North Bay, Sturgeon Falls, Sudbury... we stopped in Blind River for an ice cap at Tim Hortons... and then on to the Soo.  We got to our hotel on the Great Northern Road around 7pm - checked in and noticed that Giovanni's almost across the street, so walked over there for supper.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/IMG_0019.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_0019-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure>
<p>  Giovanni's was right full - a busy place on a Tuesday night!  We walked back to the hotel very full.  Tomorrow we hope to visit the christian book shop where Janet worked with her grandmother back in high school, and then cross over into the US and head for Duluth!</p>

<p>I'm always surprised at how little civilization there seems to be on the north shore of Lake Superior - small towns here and there, but mostly miles of trees and rocks, with the occasional abandoned motel or service centre.  Mitch drove from the Soo to Blind River and then I drove to Sudbury.  We arrived there around 7:30, got some supper and stopped at Dairy Queen for ice cream.  A very nice hotel there - we were in bed by 10pm.  </p>
<p>Up at 7 the next morning, breakfast in our hotel and on the road by 8am.  Amy drove to North Bay, and then I drove from there.  We pulled into Amy's place around 2pm and dropped them off and then home to 874 Clearcrest.  Nice to travel but nice to be home again!  And thankful for many miles safely travelled.</p>
<p>The crew at Battle Island will be packing up today - looks like nice weather for it.  They'll be a tired bunch tonight for sure!  It looks like they did get the lighthouse painted and it looks great!  Below are some pictures Nick and Eric took of the lighthouse and group.</p>
