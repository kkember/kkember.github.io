she and her husband really seem to enjoy running the store.  They have a nice selection of books and they managed to stay afloat during the pandemic by setting up an online store and having curbside pickup.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0022.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure><p>Then we headed for the bridge to the USA - a very short wait at the border - the US customs lady was very friendly, and surprised to learn we were driving to California!</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_3163.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="2448" height="3264"></figure><p>Soon we were across and into Michigan, and we headed west across the Upper Peninsula towards Duluth.  After driving for quite a while through what seemed a very remote area with no towns, stores or gas stations, I suddenly realized we were very nearly out of gas.  The van has a big tank - the last fill up was near Renfrew yesterday, and I had meant to fill up in the Soo this morning but forgot!  Google maps showed that fortunately a gas station was just 7 miles ahead - we landed there with our gauge showing a range of 22 km left which is too close for comfort - not sure how accurate it is and I don't want to find out!</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0023.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></figure><p>After filling up the tank and having lunch, we drove on.  We stopped at the little lakeside town of Munising, Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior -

the time is an hour earlier here so it's 6:30 Minnesota time.   The last time we were in Duluth was 31 years ago, just after we were married - we did the Great Circle Route around Superior - Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay to Duluth and then back to the Soo along the south side of Lake Superior.  </p><p>There is a mall across from our hotel so we headed over there for a burger at Five Guys - will check out the mall tomorrow as there is a huge Barnes and Noble store :).</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 21, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/authors/ken-kember/" rel="author">Ken Kember</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kkember.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kkember.github.io/usa-road-trip-post-1.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> USA Road Trip  - Post #1</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/usa-road-trip-post-3.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> USA Road Trip - Post #3 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kkember.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-26T18:38" class="feed__date">September 26, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/usa-road-trip-post-7.html">USA Road Trip - Post #7</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-25T20:39" class="feed__date">September 25, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/usa-road-trip-post-6.html">USA Road Trip - Post #6</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-24T20:32" class="feed__date">September 24, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/usa-road-trip-post-5.html">USA Road Trip - Post #5</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://kkember.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
