This road is only open in the summer and fall until early October.  It is narrow, winding, with the most incredible views imaginable.  Fortunately there are frequent areas where you can pull off the road to take pictures.  In the summer the road is so popular that you have to reserve a spot in advance for the day you want to drive it to help them manage the traffic flows.  It was busy today too,

but when you do it day after day it becomes tiring!  We plan to stay here in Great Falls tonight (Saturday night) as well as Sunday night.  Tomorrow we plan to go the breaking of bread in Sun River, about 20 minutes away.  Joe and Penny Clark have kindly invited us for lunch after the meeting there.  Monday we plan to drive through Glacier National Park on the \"Going to the Sun\" road which winds through the park.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>We had a leisurely breakfast in the hotel this morning because we wanted to stop by Scripture Gift and Book Shop which doesn't open until 10 am.  The current owner was surprised to learn that Janet was Margaret Frizelle's granddaughter and worked in the store during high school.  We had a nice visit with her - she and her husband really seem to enjoy running the store.  They have a nice selection of books and they managed to stay afloat during the pandemic by setting up an online store and having curbside pickup.  </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0022.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0022-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></figure>\n<p>Then we headed for the bridge to the USA - a very short wait at the border - the US customs lady was very friendly, and surprised to learn we were driving to California!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_3163.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_3163-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2448\" height=\"3264\"></figure>\n<p>Soon we were across and into Michigan, and we headed west across the Upper Peninsula towards Duluth.  After driving for quite a while through what seemed a very remote area with no towns, stores or gas stations, I suddenly realized we were very nearly out of gas.  The van has a big tank - the last fill up was near Renfrew yesterday, and I had meant to fill up in the Soo this morning but forgot!  Google maps showed that fortunately a gas station was just 7 miles ahead - we landed there with our gauge showing a range of 22 km left which is too close for comfort - not sure how accurate it is and I don't want to find out!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/IMG_0023.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xs.jpg 300w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-sm.jpg 480w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-md.jpg 768w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_0023-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></figure>\n<p>After filling up the tank and having lunch, we drove on.  We stopped at the little lakeside town of Munising, Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior -

the time is an hour earlier here so it's 6:30 Minnesota time.   The last time we were in Duluth was 31 years ago, just after we were married - we did the Great Circle Route around Superior - Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay to Duluth and then back to the Soo along the south side of Lake Superior.  </p>\n<p>There is a mall across from our hotel so we headed over there for a burger at Five Guys - will check out the mall tomorrow as there is a huge Barnes and Noble store :).</p>",
