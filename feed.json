I would usually drive in the morning.  After lunch Janet would drive while I had a nap.  We used google maps on my phone for navigation and it worked well.  Occasionally we would override google's choice of route if we wanted something more scenic.   Even though it was just two of us, having the van was so much more comfortable than a car.  A long wheel base means a smoother ride, you sit up a bit higher, and we had plenty of room for stuff we bought along the way.  The Odessey also has a very large gas tank of 21 gallons.  At optimal highway driving, we could go more than 1000 km on one tank, although a<span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">fter our near miss in northern Michigan, we always looked to keep the gas gauge well above a quarter full!  We listened to audiobooks (</span><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color);
