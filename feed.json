right now.  This is a combination of the time of year (lowest water flow in the fall) and an ongoing drought.  You can see on the rock in the middle of the lake bed what the normal water level would have been.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_0323.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\"
