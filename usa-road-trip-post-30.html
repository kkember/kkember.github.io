I would usually drive in the morning.  After lunch Janet would drive while I had a nap.  We used google maps on my phone for navigation and it worked well.  Occasionally we would override google's choice of route if we wanted something more scenic.   Even though it was just two of us, having the van was so much more comfortable than a car.  A long wheel base means a smoother ride, you sit up a bit higher, and we had plenty of room for stuff we bought along the way.  The Odessey also has a very large gas tank of 21 gallons.  At optimal highway driving, we could go more than 1000 km on one tank, although a<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">fter our near miss in northern Michigan, we always looked to keep the gas gauge well above a quarter full!  We listened to audiobooks (</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Lord of the Rings narrated by Andy Serkus -

especially the mid-west.  When you drive for days and still are a long way from the coast, the distance sinks in a bit more</li><li>the variety of landscapes - we expected some parts to be flat and somewhat boring, but each part of the country has its own charm.  There were some surprises along the way - the scenery from Glacier National Park to Kalispell, the mountain pass to get into Yosemite, the drive from Kayenta to Moab, and the mountain passes coming into Denver from the west. </li><li>a flexible schedule allowed for unexpected sightseeing - quite a number of times we happened upon areas that were worth exploring and so we stopped and checked them out - the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the town of Ferndale, the Humbolt Redwoods State Park in Northern California, the town square in Washington Illinois.  I suppose if we had done more research in advance these wouldn't have been surprises.  Still, it was nice to have the flexibility to stop and enjoy these places.  </li><li>being able to get off the Interstate and use other roads makes for more interesting driving.  And many of these secondary highways are quite good and have a speed limit of 65 mph so you can still make good time.  We enjoyed these roads in Montana, the Oregon Coast, the trip to Yosemite, and heading north from Kayenta.</li><li>meeting up with family, friends and fellow-believers.  Seeing where Mitch lives in California and spending time with him, dinner with Carolyn and Steve, visiting with Joe and Penny Clark in Montana, and being with the believers in Spring Creek - these were all highlights of our trip.  </li></ul><p>Here is an overall map of our trip...</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM.png" alt="" width="1634" height="1080" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-xs.png 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-sm.png 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-md.png 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-lg.png 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-xl.png 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/36/responsive/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-5.01.22-PM-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Well, that concludes this blog series -
