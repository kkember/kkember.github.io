the bus wended its way slowly through Poole and Bournmouth finally arriving at the train station in Bournemouth.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/IMG_1999.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_1999-2xl.jpg 1600w"><figcaption>Bournemouth Train Station</figcaption></figure><p>Our arrival at Waterloo was about 40 minutes later than planned, so not too bad.  We then took the tube to our airbnb at Holland Bush.  This area is still in Kensington, but a few miles west of where we were in Holland Park.  It seems like a bit of a rougher area, and much busier.  There is a large mall adjacent to the tube station, with Marks and Spencer, Waitrose, John Lewis and many other major stores.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/IMG_2006.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2006-2xl.jpg 1600w"><figcaption>Street near the Shepherds Bush Tube Station</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/IMG_2007.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2007-2xl.jpg 1600w"><figcaption>Shepherds Bush Tube Station</figcaption></figure><p>The tube line was extremely crowded - apparently there is a staff shortage so trains were not running very frequently.  We managed to manhandle our two large suitcases onboard.  When we arrived at our airbnb, there was someone there to let us in.  Unfortunately his key would not work so we waited for half an hour that to get solved.  </p><p>Once we were finally in, the place was nice, with high ceilings and recently renovated kitchen and bathroom.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/IMG_2009.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-xs.jpg 300w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-sm.jpg 480w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-md.jpg 768w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-lg.jpg 1024w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-xl.jpg 1360w, https://kkember.github.io/media/posts/45/responsive/IMG_2009-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>There were a few issues with the flat in terms of cleanliness - we contacted the owner and she was very responsive.  We headed over to the mall for a few groceries and clean sheets for the bed (which the owner reimbursed us for).  The place isn't as nice as the one we had at Holland Park - that's always the risk you take with airbnb.  And to be fair, the owner has been really responsive including offering a re-cleaning of the flat or a price reduction.  And the one in Holland Park was by far the nicest one I've ever had (and I've stayed at 15 places before this one).    </p><p>Sunday morning we headed out for Bermondsey Gospel Hall, the same place we went last week.  There was a couple from Scotland visiting as well - they took the overnight sleeper train from Glasgow and were having a short holiday in London.  There were also a couple of young women from the US meeting up with a cousin from India in London for a holiday.  We enjoyed our time with the believers there.  In talking with one of the elders there, he mentioned that he was likely the only one who was still in Bermondsey from when we were there back in 2008.  They get a lot of people coming to London for school or work, and if they decide to stay in the area, then they end up moving out of the city because housing prices are so high.</p><p>We headed to Liberty London again to have lunch at the cafe there - we really enjoyed it last time so decided to do it again, and Janet wanted to do some shopping there.  I headed back to the flat for a nap. </p><p>Janet was back around 6pm and we had supper in the flat and called it a night.  Tomorrow is a shopping day - on google maps it is showing 13 fabric stores within a kilometre of here!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 18, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kkember.github.io/authors/ken-kember/" rel="author">Ken Kember</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kkember.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kkember.github.io/england-2023-day-8.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> England 2023 -
